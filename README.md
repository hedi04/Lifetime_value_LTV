# Lifetime_value_LTV

The goal is to recommend a Driverâ€™s Lifetime Value (i.e. the value a driver brings to a peer-to-peer car sharing company over the entire projected lifetime).

There are two notebooks describing the exploratory data analysis and the modeling part.

For questions, please feel free to contact me.
